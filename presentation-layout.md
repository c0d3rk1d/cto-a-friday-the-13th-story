## CTO: Code, Terror & Outages – A Friday the 13th Story

The Reality Behind the Code, Chaos & Coffee.

## What Even Is a CTO?

## CTO is ...

- Chief
- Technology
- Officer

Engineer boss with a private office while the rest of the team looks for a table to sit and work!

A CTO (Chief Technology Officer) is responsible for aligning the company's technology vision with its business goals. They guide engineering teams, set technical strategy, ensure system scalability and security, and act as a bridge between executive leadership and developers. For full-stack developers like you, understanding the CTO's role helps you see how your work fits into the bigger picture—how a single feature impacts user experience, infrastructure, and long-term company vision.

## My Regular Day as a CTO

- 8 AM: Debugging a production fire you didn’t start
- 10 AM: Talking to investors about why your AI will change the world
- 1 PM: Refactoring spaghetti code from MVP days
- 3 PM: Sprint planning with product & design
- 5 PM: Mentoring junior devs / coaching co-founder
- 8 PM: Lying awake thinking about scale
- 10 PM: Trying to plan your day... tomorrow... Zzzz...

## Trade-offs I Constantly Make

- Fast
- Secure
- Scalable

Pick 2 (maybe). Master the trade-offs.

## It's Friday the 13th, Today

So, let me explain—being a CTO often feels like living in a horror movie.

- **The Haunted Tech Stack** – Legacy Code: The crypt you can't escape
- **The Fires That Never Die** – Incident hell: Every day is Friday the 13th
- **Stakeholders: The Vampires of Time** – Meetings that suck the life out of you
- **The Zombie Projects** – The projects that won’t stay dead
- **The Dark Magic of Leadership** – Wizardry, witchcraft, and wardrobe changes

New devs often think they’ll always build from scratch—truth is, you inherit a lot. CTOs must balance innovation with maintaining legacy systems.

Production issues happen. Often. And late at night. CTOs are ultimately accountable, but devs are the frontline heroes.

CTOs spend lots of time translating between business and tech. You’ll need to explain technical choices to non-technical people.

Manage expectations and document decisions. Track why a project was paused or killed—so history doesn’t repeat.

Leadership is more about people than code. CTOs mentor, resolve conflict, hire smartly, and protect team focus.

## Top 5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Becoming a CTO

- Tech is the easy part — people are the hard part.
- You'll write less code but make a bigger impact.
- Your job changes every 3–6 months.
- Document everything. Future-you will thank you.
- Vision without execution is hallucination. Lead both.

## If You Want to Be a CTO...

- Build stuff. Break stuff. Ship stuff.
- Join a startup early. Wear all the hats.
- Learn how to talk to humans (yes, even sales & marketing).
- Mentor others. Lead teams. Take ownership.
- Stay curious. Tech changes. So must you.

## TL;DR

Being a CTO is:

- Intense
- High-impact
- Strategic
- Purpose-driven
- And insanely fun — if you're built for it.

## Thank You
